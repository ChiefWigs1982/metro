This is a simple, classy theme inspired by the Metro UI from Windows Phone.


== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).


== Installation ==

Once the theme is installed, use the "Metro Theme Options" page in the control panel to choose the Theme (Dark or Light) and the Accent (any colour you like)

You can then create a menu (via the "Menus" interface) and use it for the "Primary Navigation".
* Ideally this menu will only have a couple of pages in to fill the header
* If you don't create a menu, the header will just be populated with the site title as a link
